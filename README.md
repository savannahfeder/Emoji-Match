# Emoji Match 🎉

**Meet Emoji Match, a game where you battle your opponent using emojis to come as close as possible to 15 emoji points, without going over.**

Each emoji is assigned a value and your score is then calculated as the sum of your emojis’ values. If you end the game with a higher score than your opponent — the computer — without surpassing 15 points, you win! 🥳

### Your Opponent
The computer randomly generates between one and three emojis that you are to compete with for the highest score. It works by generating new emojis up until the number of emojis has reached three or the next generated emoji would put them above the 15 point limit.
