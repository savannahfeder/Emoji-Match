# Emoji Match 🎉

**Meet Emoji Match, a game where you battle your opponent using emojis to come as close as possible to 15 emoji points.** Each emoji is assigned a value, and your score is then calculated as the sum of your emojis’ values. If you end the game with a higher score than your opponent — the computer — without surpassing 15 points, you win! 🥳

### Your Opponent
When you're satisfied with your emojis and hit the **Submit Game** button, the computer will then randomly generates between one and three emojis that you are to compete against for the highest score. It works by generating new emojis until the number of emojis has reached three or the next generated emoji would put the computer above the 15 point limit.
